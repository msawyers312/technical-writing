I thought the whole process was fairly easy to understand. The only thing I had some trouble with was trying to make a folder, but now that it's been shown I understand. The process in which folders are created within a file reminds of what can be found in my computer harddrive via file explorer-- that or when you go to a website and the url adds a /something whenever you click on a link that deviates from the home page. All in all I think the best way to learn is by actually doing rather than reading about it or simply watching a tutorial without following along.
